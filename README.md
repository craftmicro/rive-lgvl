## Author notes

I've had experience implementing a Rive player using another rendering library, so I'm fairly certain that LVGL will **not** be able to support all features of Rive. However, I'm hopeful it can support enough features to be useful.

My aim is to eventually use the Craft Micro SDK for rendering Rive files, but the SDK is not ready for that yet :)
